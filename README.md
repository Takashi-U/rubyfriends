TODO
====

- add atom feed
- add google analytics
- get about page text and paste it in

- hashtags
  - #RubyFriends will always be
  - #RubyConf is also currently set to work
  - each conference has its own tag
    - we could just list all known conferences BUT
      - on the homepage we say which tags to use and
        want to have it say the current or upcoming conference
      - so, each conference, its hashtag and date could be listed in a yaml file and then we just show tag for > last conference & <= the last day of the last conference? Maybe there is a much simpler way? Discuss.
