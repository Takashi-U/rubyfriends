  - each conference has its own tag
    - we could just list all known conferences BUT
      - on the homepage we say which tags to use and
        want to have it always say the current or upcoming conference
      - so, each conference could list its date in the yaml file
        and then we just so the tag for > last conference & <= the last day of
        the last conference? Maybe there is a much simpler way? Discuss.
